For our first paired project in Mod3 at Turing, we were assigned to create something like `Rotten Tomatoes`. An application that would allow the user to see all the movies when they visit the page. It allows them to search for a movie, they can click on the poster of the movie to be directed to the details page. The details page allowed the user to see the run time of a movie, the budget, an overview, the revenue, and the genre. They also had the ability to see clips and videos from Youtube.

Understand Reactâ€™s key concepts such as components, state, props, and the component lifecycle. Use cypress to verify that components render correctly and respond to user interactions. Use a routing library like `react-router-dom` to manage navigation in your React application.

Wins:
- We wanted to create a carousel for the landing page of our application, we did research and found a couple that looked great. But instead of installing a package to get a carousel, we created one.  
- Creating a better way to display the movie information in-front of the movie poster. 

Challenges:
- We both agree cypress testing can be challenging, It was a rough start but we started to get a hand on it as we went on.
